Backend Methods That Can Be Deleted Without Affecting Frontend
After examining your backend code structure and comparing it with your frontend implementation, here are the methods that can be safely deleted without impacting your frontend functionality:

Authentication Controller/Service
refreshToken - Your frontend has code for this but never actually calls it
validateToken - Not used by frontend which relies on server responses
revokeToken - Frontend only uses simple logout without explicit token revocation
User Controller/Service

searchUsers - Frontend only uses direct ID lookup and full listing
updateUserRole - Frontend only checks if a user is ADMIN or not
getUsersByStatus - No filtering by status in frontend
deactivateUser - No user deactivation functionality in frontend
getUserStatistics - No user statistics displayed in frontend
Item Controller/Service

searchItemsByMultipleParams - Frontend only filters by location
getItemsByCategory - Frontend loads all items and filters client-side
getItemsByBrand - Not used in frontend
getItemVersionHistory - No history tracking in frontend
getItemStatistics - No item statistics in frontend
bulkUpdateItems - Frontend updates items individually
Rental Controller/Service

searchRentals - Frontend uses simple active/history lists
getRentalStatistics - No rental statistics in frontend
bulkProcessRentals - Frontend processes rentals individually
cancelRental - No cancel functionality in frontend
updateRentalNotes - No notes functionality in frontend
Review Controller/Service

updateReview - Frontend only creates reviews, never updates them
deleteReview - No review deletion in frontend
getReviewsByRating - Frontend displays all reviews without filtering
getUserReviews - Frontend only gets reviews by item
checkUserReviewEligibility - Frontend uses simpler hasUserReviewedRental
These methods can be safely removed as they're not utilized by your current frontend implementation. This will make your backend more maintainable and focused on the actual requirements of your application.
